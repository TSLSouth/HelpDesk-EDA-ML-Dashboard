## IT HELP DESK PROJECT ##

Was difficult to found some useful data bases about help desk services in Kaggle. So, we used a very simple one. 
it seems that help desk companies have restricted access to their data as it's user personal data.

STEP #1 

With the first check and Exploratory Data Analysis (using Python on a Jupiter Notebook in a VSCODE IDE) 
we found that we didnÂ´t have any feature that could be used to ML and build a Predictve Model to discover
our target: Satisfaction with the service.

STEP #2 

So, we build a dashboard using Power BI to try to get some insights.

## FINDINGS ##

1. It was clear that for some critical and severe severity issues, they were given low priority. 
Was it an error and needs to be fixed?

2. We can observe who are the ITOwners with more tickets open for long days and who are the top
requestors. Further undesrtanding about this item need to be done to recommend decisions.
